        <h3>Push Ups</h3>
        <p>Push-ups are undoubtedly the most classic and popular exercise for strengthening the core and upper body muscle. It is a no-equipment exercise that means you can perform it anywhere, anytime. If you want to do only one workout to stay fit then push-ups are the best choice as this exercise targets all the important muscles of the body like arms,
           chest, shoulders, and abs. But you just cannot keep pumping up and wondering if you are doing enough or not. </p>
        <p>Push-ups are an excellent form of strength-building exercise, but many people either overdo it or underdo it. Push-ups are a difficult exercise and to master this form of exercise, all you need to do is practice.
           It can be challenging for beginners and especially for those who are overweight. But do not worry, even if you are able to do two push-ups in the initial phase, then do it. Try to improve yourself gradually. There is no limit to how many push-ups one can do in a day. Many people do more than 300 push-ups a day. But for an average person, even 50 to 100 push-ups should be enough to maintain a good upper body, provided it is done properly.</p>

      <div class="col-md-6 text-justify wow slideInLeft">
        <h3>How To Do Push Ups</h3>
        <p>Start in a plank position, face-down with your body straight. Put your palms flat on the ground with your arms straight, in line with your shoulders.
          Keep your feet together or about 12 inches apart, with your weight on the balls of your feet.
          Make sure your back is straight and your weight is evenly spread out.
          Look down as you do your push-ups to make sure your spine is in line from your neck all the way down.
          Lower your body toward the ground, using controlled movement, until your elbows are at 90-degree angles. Then push back up to a plank position.
          For best results, lower slowly and push up quickly. When you begin, try taking 2 seconds to lower and then 1 second to push up. </p>
